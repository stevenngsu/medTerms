# medTerms

A wordle consisting of medical terms from personally made medical dictionary. Affixes were compiled, compared them with a dictionary text document, and created terms to form a json file.

The game consists of the prefix and suffix definitions and with those, the player guesses the word. The game is targeted towards medical students and is NOT intended for everyone to play, so an individual who is not familiar with medical terms may struggle in this game.

The reason for this project is to provide a tool/game in studying medical terminology.

Tools Used: Python, Selenium, JSON, JavaScript, ReactJS

Note: create .env file to FAST_REFRESH=false to auto refresh on code edit
